## Problem

I want to publish my codebase as a professional portfolio project, making it easy for employers and clients to review my work, understand the project, and see my coding standards.

## Appetite

1 week

## Solution

- Remove all sensitive data and secrets
- Clean up unused files, dead code, and comments
- Add a clear, concise README with:
  - Project description
  - Features
  - Setup instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Contribution guidelines
  - License
  - Placeholder for screenshots/demo links
- Add an MIT LICENSE file
- Ensure code style consistency (lint, format)
- Add or update .gitignore
- Remove dev/local artifacts
- Ensure build and deploy scripts work
- Add basic test coverage or a test report

## Boundaries

- No major new features or rewrites
- No non-essential dependencies
- No over-polishing

## Risks

- Accidentally publishing secrets
- Missing documentation details
