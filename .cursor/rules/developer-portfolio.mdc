Fully audit this codebase and README, confirm all tech stack and functionality. Do not write a summary yet. Just output key facts with 100% certainty.

Now, based on those facts, write the full polished developer portfolio summary as below:

Project Overview (short paragraph summarizing the app's purpose and audience)

Key Features (clear bullet points, including both user and admin features)

User Flow (step-by-step of a typical user journey)

Architecture and Backend Design (important design decisions, tech stack used, database models if any)

Security Measures (authentication, authorization, data protection)

UI/UX Details (frameworks, animations, special touches)
Technical Challenges Overcome (significant problems you solved â€” processing, scaling, auth, etc.)

Tech Stack Breakdown (frontend, backend, third-party services, devops, testing)

Impact and Problem Solved (why this project matters; how it helps users)

My Role in the Project (so I can edit in my exact contribution: e.g., Full-Stack Dev, Backend Lead, etc.)

Be confident and factual. No hedging ("likely", "potentially") unless truly unavoidable.
Structure it cleanly and make it easy for a non-technical hiring manager to understand.
Highlight anything unique, novel, or technically impressive."
